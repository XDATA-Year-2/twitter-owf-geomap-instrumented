===============================

OWF integrated version of geomap; receives repositioning messages via "map.view.center.bounds". 

This is a fork of the Kitware Tangelo Geomap application.  The UI has been adjusted to better suit smaller windows, like what will be available running as a widget in the Ozone Widgets Framework.
